 **AI Pothole Detection System**

**Objective:**

To design an intelligent system to identify potholes on roads in real-time employing computer vision and machine learning, with the aim to enhance road safety and facilitate timely maintenance.

#### **Overview:**

Potholes are a real safety risk to motorists, particularly in heavy traffic urban environments. Conventional pothole detection and repair depends much on manual visual inspection, which is time-consuming and suboptimal. This project puts forward an artificial intelligence-driven solution where potholes are detected automatically using image processing and deep learning algorithms from video streams or photographs taken by vehicle-mounted or drone-mounted cameras.

#### **Key Features:**

* **Real-time detection** by utilizing pre-trained CNN models such as YOLOv5 or MobileNet.
* **Auto-alerts** to city authorities with GPS location tagging.
* **Map integration** to see pothole density within regions.
* **Dataset generation** by crowd-sourced or drone imaging of roads.

#### **Implementation:**

* **Data Collection:** Collect images/videos of potholed roads via dashcams or open-source datasets.
* **Preprocessing:** Use methods such as grayscale, noise removal, and edge detection.
* **Model Training:** Train a deep learning model (YOLO, SSD, etc.) on pothole images that are labeled.
* **Deployment:** Create a light-weight app or web dashboard to visualize the detections and alerts.
* **Optional:** Utilize IoT sensors and GPS for location-based services and severity analysis.

#### **Technologies Used:**

* Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch
* YOLOv5 / SSD MobileNet for object detection
* GPS/GIS mapping tools
* Flask/React for frontend dashboard (optional)

#### **Applications:**

* Smart city infrastructure monitoring
* Road maintenance planning for municipalities
* Real-time warnings to drivers on road hazards
* Route optimization and safety for insurance and fleet companies

#### **Final Outcome:**

A working prototype that can accurately identify potholes from real-world images and automatically alert, thus decreasing response time for road repair and enhancing commuter safety.

#### **Future Scope:**

* Integration with autonomous car systems for navigating road hazards.
* Create a citizen-reporting application whereby users can report potholes.
* Employ AI to forecast road deterioration patterns as well as maintenance schedules.
